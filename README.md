# Dog-Breed-Classification-CNN
The project implement an algorithm to classify dog breed with CNN (from scratch) and pretrained Inception_v3 model (transfer learning).

The notebook is divided into separate steps and the links can be used to navigate the notebook.

* [Step 0](#step0): Import Datasets
* [Step 1](#step1): Detect Humans
* [Step 2](#step2): Detect Dogs
* [Step 3](#step3): Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
* [Step 4](#step4): Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
