# Dog-Breed-Classification-CNN
The project implement an algorithm to classify dog breed with CNN (from scratch) and pretrained Inception_v3 model (transfer learning).

The notebook is divided into separate steps.

* Step 0: Import Datasets
* Step 1: Detect Humans
* Step 2: Detect Dogs
* Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
* Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
